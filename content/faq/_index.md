## What is After Nine?

After Nine is a platform committed to championing women’s professional sports. We're on a mission to make make it easy to find, watch, and attend women's pro sporting events in your area, by showcasing all game information in a central place. After Nine also aims to celebrate female athletes competing at the highest levels by sharing their stories and creating a fun, positive space for their fans to connect with one another.    


## What does After Nine stand for? Who started it? 
First of all: Hi! I’m so happy you made it here. I’m Caitlin Scott, the founder. You can read more about me and all the amazing people who helped get After Nine off the ground here. 

I started working on After Nine in 2018 after making a personal challenge to attend more professional women’s sporting events in New York. I couldn’t find a great place to access game and tournament information for all the games near me in one place, so I decided to make one.

The name After Nine is a reference to ‘Title IX’ of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, a federal law created to help prevent gender discrimination in the United States educational athletic system. A brief refresher: Title IX stipulates that public schools and universities must offer equal academic and athletic opportunities to men and women, which has had a significant impact on the number of female students who participate in sports across the United States. In 1974, fewer than 300,000 girls played high school sports—today, <a href="https://www.nfhs.org/ParticipationStatistics/ParticipationStatistics/">3.4 million do.</a> 

Yet, 46 years after the passing of Title IX, female athletes continue to fight for equal pay, greater representation in mainstream media, and against sexism and misogyny. 

Since starting After Nine, I’ve read a lot about the barriers female athletes face. As someone who began her career in media, I’m especially interested in research that focuses on the coverage of female athletes. According to the Tucker Center for Research on Girls & Women in Sport at the University of Minnesota, <a href="http://www.cehd.umn.edu/tuckercenter/projects/mediacoverage.html">it’s estimated</a> that while 40 percent of American athletes are female, women’s sports receive only 4 percent of media coverage. Furthermore, a <a href="https://wmc.3cdn.net/83bf6082a319460eb1_hsrm680x2.pdf">2015 report</a> by The Women’s Media Center showed that only 10.2 percent of sports coverage in 2014 was produced by women and 90 percent of sports editors are men. 

It’s clear we need more coverage of women’s sports—especially coverage that is created by women, and I want to help. With this in mind, I’m excited to share After Nine with you. I hope this site will make it easier for you to find pro women’s games to watch and have fun while doing it. Have a question or want to get in touch? Email me: HERE.
